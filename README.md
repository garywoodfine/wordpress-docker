## WordPress Docker compose development environment

 provides an example of using Docker Compose to install WordPress with PHPMyAdmin as an extra. 
 
 WordPress usually runs on a LAMP stack - Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. 
 
 The official WordPress Docker image includes Apache and PHP for us, so the only part we have to worry about is MySQL and this image we include PHPMyAdmin to assist in administering the database.
